Event 0003 evaluates the Section 301 List 2 tariffs on Chinese goods, announced on 2018-07-10 and enforced on 2018-08-23. This event is selected as the cleanest follow-on to event_0002 because it uses the same authority and mechanism, occurs in the same tariff cycle, and provides a distinct escalation window with a clear announcement-to-enforcement gap. The purpose is to test repeatability of the pass-through and sign-based falsification logic under a second closely related shock, without changing model mechanics. The event will be evaluated on a minimal, manufacturing-cost-linked firm set with explicit ex ante exclusions for IP-licensing-dominated firms, so the test remains aligned to the model’s cost-to-margin assumptions and avoids post hoc selection.
