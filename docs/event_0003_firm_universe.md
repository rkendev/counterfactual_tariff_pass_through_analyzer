# Event 0003 – Candidate Firm Universe

This document defines the initial firm universe for event_0003
(US Section 301 tariffs on Chinese goods, List 2).

The objective is to select a minimal, defensible firm set whose
gross margins are plausibly affected by manufacturing cost shocks
from Chinese import tariffs.

## Inclusion criteria

A firm is included if, during 2018:

- It sells hardware or manufactured goods materially exposed to Chinese sourcing
- Cost of goods sold is a meaningful driver of gross margin
- Public filings explicitly reference China-based manufacturing or sourcing

## Candidate firm set

The following firms are included for initial evaluation:

- AAPL — hardware manufacturing and assembly exposure
- HPQ — PC and printer hardware manufacturing exposure
- DELL — PC and enterprise hardware manufacturing exposure
- CSCO — network equipment manufacturing exposure

These firms mirror the event_0002 universe to enable controlled
repeatability across tariff lists.

## Explicit exclusions (ex ante)

The following firms are excluded prior to analysis to avoid
structural bias:

- QCOM — IP licensing and royalty revenue dominate margins; COGS-based
  tariff pass-through is not the primary driver of gross margin changes

## Notes

This firm universe is intentionally small to preserve interpretability.
Additional firms may be added only if they satisfy the same inclusion
criteria and do not require model changes.
