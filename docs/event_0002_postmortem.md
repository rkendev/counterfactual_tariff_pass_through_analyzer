## 2. Firm Selection and Exposure Proxy

### Candidate Firms

- AAPL  
- CSCO  
- HPQ  
- QCOM  
- DELL  

These firms were selected because they:

- Operated in hardware or hardware adjacent sectors in 2018  
- Had disclosed China related manufacturing or sourcing exposure  
- Were plausibly affected by List 1 tariff categories  

### Exposure Proxy

Exposure is encoded as a binary indicator derived from public disclosures rather than estimated import values.
